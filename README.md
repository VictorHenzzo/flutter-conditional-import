# flutter-conditional-import

This repository contains a Flutter plugin and an example app demonstrating how 
to handle multiple platforms using conditional export statements based on the platform 
Flutter is running on. The main idea is to provide different implementations of functionalities 
for specific platforms (such as iOS, Android, Web, etc.) and automatically export the correct 
implementation based on the runtime environment.
